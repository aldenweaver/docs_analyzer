## Step 2: [Second Major Step]

[Explain what you'll accomplish in this step and how it builds on Step 1]

```python
# Code for step 2
# Build on the previous code

def create_message(prompt):
    """Helper function to create messages."""
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ]
    )
    return response

# Test the function
result = create_message("Hello, Claude!")
print(result.content)
```

**What's happening here?**
- [Explanation of new concept introduced]
- [Why this approach was chosen]
- [How this connects to the overall goal]

### Verify Step 2

[Verification instructions]

## Step 3: [Third Major Step]

[Continue the pattern for remaining steps]

[Detailed instructions and code]

```python
# Code for step 3
# Continue building the application

[code here]
```

---

## Step 4: [Final Step]

[Bring everything together]

Here's the complete application:

```python
# complete_application.py
# Full working code with all steps combined

import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(
    api_key="your-api-key-here"
)

def create_message(prompt):
    """Create a message using Claude."""
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ]
    )
    return response

def main():
    """Main application logic."""
    # [Application logic]
    result = create_message("Your prompt here")
    print(result.content)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Test the Complete Application

Run the full application:

```bash
python complete_application.py
```

Expected output:
```
[Complete expected output]
```

**Congratulations!** You've successfully [accomplished the goal].
