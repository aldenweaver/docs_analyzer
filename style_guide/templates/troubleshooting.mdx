## Best Practices to Avoid Issues

Follow these practices to prevent common problems:

### Error Handling

Always implement proper error handling:

```python
import anthropic
from anthropic import APIError

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

try:
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
    )
except APIError as e:
    print(f"API error: {e}")
    # Handle error appropriately
```

### Rate Limiting

Implement exponential backoff:

```python
import time

def create_with_retry(client, **kwargs):
    """Create message with retry logic."""
    max_retries = 3
    backoff_factor = 2

    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return client.messages.create(**kwargs)
        except anthropic.RateLimitError:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            wait_time = backoff_factor ** attempt
            time.sleep(wait_time)
```

### Input Validation

Validate inputs before sending requests:

```python
def validate_message(content, max_tokens):
    """Validate message parameters."""
    if not content:
        raise ValueError("Content cannot be empty")
    if max_tokens < 1 or max_tokens > 4096:
        raise ValueError("max_tokens must be between 1 and 4096")
    # Additional validation...
```
