Tokens are typically hidden when interacting with language models at the \"text\" level but become relevant when examining the exact inputs and outputs of a language model. When Claude is provided with text to evaluate, the text (consisting of a series of characters) is encoded into a series of tokens for the model to process. Larger tokens enable data efficiency during inference and pretraining (and are utilized when possible), while smaller tokens allow a model to handle uncommon or never-before-seen words.
