# Understanding Our Platform

## What is an API Key?

An API Key is basically a unique identifier for authentication. api keys are used to authenticate requests. Your API-key should be kept secret.

## Users and Accounts

A user is someone who uses the system. An account represents a user's profile. Each account has a User associated with it.

### User Roles

There are different types of users:
- admin users
- Regular Users
- guest users

## Rate Limiting

Our API implements rate-limiting to prevent abuse. Rate limits are applied per API key. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a 429 error.

The rate-limit is 1000 requests per hour.

## Webhooks

webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications. A webhook is simply an HTTP callback. You can configure webhooks in the dashboard.

### Setting Up Webhooks

To setup a webhook:

1. Navigate to settings
2. Click on "webhooks"
3. Enter your webhook URL
4. Select events
5. Save

## Data Models

### User Model

The user model contains:
- id
- Name

### Account Model

Each Account has:
- account_id

## authentication

Authentication is handled via API keys. You must include your api key in all requests. Simply add it to the Authorization header.

Example:

```
