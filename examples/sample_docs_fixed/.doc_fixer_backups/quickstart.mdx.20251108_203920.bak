# Getting Started with the API

This guide will simply help you get started with our API. It's really easy to use and can be quickly integrated into your application in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you should basically have the following things that are needed for getting started with the integration process:
- An API key that can be obtained from your dashboard
- Basic knowledge of making HTTP requests
- A development environment that has been set up properly

## Installation Process

The installation process is really simple and can be easily completed by running the following command:

```
npm install @example/sdk
```

Just run the above command and the package will be installed automatically.

## Making Your First Request

Here's how you can simply make your first API call to our endpoint which will return the data:

```python
import example_sdk

client = example_sdk.Client(api_key="your-key-here")
response = client.get("/endpoint")
print(response.json())
```

The response will be returned in JSON format and can be processed by your application.

## Next Steps

After you have completed this quickstart guide, you can explore the <a href="./api-reference.mdx">API Reference</a> to learn more about the available endpoints, or check out the authentication guide to understand how authentication is handled by the system.

You might also want to look at our examples page which has lots of different examples that show various use cases.
