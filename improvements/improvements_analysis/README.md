## Key Findings Summary

### Top 5 Critical Issues

1. **MCP Documentation Fragmentation**
   - Problem: 7+ locations, 1,270-line mega-page, contradictions
   - Impact: Users can't find canonical information
   - Solution: Complete reorganization (detailed in mockup)

2. **Missing Production Patterns**
   - Problem: Zero error handling examples despite comprehensive error docs
   - Impact: Fragile production deployments
   - Solution: Add production-ready code to all major pages

3. **Inconsistent Style (47+ Issues)**
   - Problem: Mixed capitalization, voice, formatting
   - Impact: Unprofessional, confusing
   - Solution: Comprehensive style guide + enforcement

4. **"Hard to Understand" Content**
   - Problem: Technical accuracy without user comprehension
   - Impact: Cognitive overload, misuse of features
   - Solution: Rewrite with progressive disclosure + visuals

5. **Broken Navigation (10+ 404s)**
   - Problem: Missing expected pages, broken links
   - Impact: Frustration, poor discoverability
   - Solution: Create missing pages, fix all links

### Strengths Identified
